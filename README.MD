The model is programmed with Wolfram Mathematica 14. All files need to be downloaded in the same folder to run the model.

To run the time trajectory simulations:

23_10_04_plot_time_trajectories_1.nb

To run the final state simulations:

23_10_04_plot_final_states_1.nb

To show the primary effects of temperature:

23_10_04_plot_FvFm_and_primary_effects_1.nb

The following auxiliary files define the model equations, the styles for plotting, and the default parameter values:

23_10_04_simulation_1.m
23_10_04_styles_1.m
23_10_04_parameters_1.m
